# Light Visiblity test for KHR_node_visibility

## Tags

[testing](../Models-testing.md)

## Extensions

### Required

* KHR_node_visibility

### Used

* KHR_node_visibility
* KHR_animation_pointer
* KHR_lights_punctual
* KHR_node_visibility

## Summary

This model demonstrates the `KHR_node_visibility` extension and its interaction with `KHR_animation_pointer`.

This model demonstrates the `KHR_node_visibility` extension and its interaction with `KHR_animation_pointer`.

- If your implementation shows either of the red spotlights, it is not compliant with `KHR_node_visibility`.

- If your implementation does not have the blue spotlight hiding and showing every 0.5 seconds, either the animation is not playing, or it does not support using `KHR_animation_pointer` to animate the `KHR_node_visibility` visible property.
